## 👀 About the project
Project carried out with the intention of practicing the consumption of api, the api used is the github one, with axios, which even before was done with javascript fetch, in addition to developing more hardskils in relation to the React library.

The app aims to present the repositories, using a modal window of a given user, also bringing some other information, they also have a way to search for a specific repository, in addition to a pagination.

**Ahhh! Just an observation if the user has more than 20 repositories, the application only brings the 20 most current ones.**
